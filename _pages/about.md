Hello everyone, Iâ€™m Zhihao. 

I am a PhD student in Computer Science jointly trained by the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China and the University of Glasgow, under the supervision of [Professor Xiaoning Zhang](https://www.sice.uestc.edu.cn/info/1450/11646.htm)  and [IEEE Fellow Professor Muhammad Imran](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/engineering/staff/muhammadimran/). I earned my graduate degree in Information and Communication Engineering from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China in 2022 and my undergraduate degree in Network Engineering from the same university in 2019.

My current research focuses on machine learning, distributed optimization, large models, and network engineering. Specific topics include:

- Efficient Federated Learning in edge heterogeneous environments
- Optimization of Large Model inference
- Satellite communication networks

Becoming an inventor has been my dream since childhood. I hope to use my knowledge, imagination, and courage to change the world. My childhood idol was Einstein, and now my idol is Elon Musk.

I am very excited to be part of artificial intelligence research. My ultimate goal is to have humanoid robots serving households everywhere. Therefore, I plan to enter the humanoid robotics industry after completing my PhD, and I hope to have my own startup in the future.
